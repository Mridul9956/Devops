## 🌍 OSI & TCP/IP Models – How Data Moves

Think of networks like a **postal service** for data. The **OSI (7 layers)** and **TCP/IP (4 layers)** models explain how information is sent, received, and processed.

* **Application Layer** – This is where web browsing, emails, and messaging happen (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).
    
* **Transport Layer** – Ensures data arrives safely, like a delivery tracking system (e.g., TCP, UDP).
    
* **Network Layer** – Helps find the best route for data, like a GPS for internet packets (e.g., IP addressing).
    

Each layer plays a role in ensuring smooth and **secure data communication**!

## 🔗 DevOps Protocols & Ports

Different network services use **specific protocols and port numbers** to communicate. Some of the most important ones in DevOps include:

* **HTTP/HTTPS (80/443)** – Loads websites securely.
    
* **FTP (21)** – Transfers files between systems.
    
* **SSH (22)** – Secure remote login to servers.
    
* **DNS (53)** – Converts domain names (like [google.com](http://google.com)) into IP addresses.
    

These protocols keep **applications running smoothly and securely** across networks!

## ☁️ AWS EC2 & Security Groups – Cloud Basics

AWS **EC2** lets you create a **virtual server** in the cloud. But security matters!

* **Security Groups** act like firewalls, controlling access to your cloud instance.
    
* They **define rules** for what kind of traffic can enter or leave your server.
    

By setting up **security rules**, you ensure your cloud environment is **safe and efficient**

## 🔍 Essential Networking Commands

DevOps engineers often **use commands** to check connectivity, troubleshoot networks, and interact with servers. Here are some useful ones:

* **ping** – Tests if a system is reachable.
    
* **traceroute / tracert** – Tracks how data moves across networks.
    
* **netstat** – Shows active network connections.
    
* **curl** – Sends HTTP requests via the command line.
    
* **dig / nslookup** – Looks up domain names and IPs.
    

These commands help **diagnose and optimize** network performance!
